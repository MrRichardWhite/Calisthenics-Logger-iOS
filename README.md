# Calisthenics-Logger-iOS

This repository holds the source code for my app "Calisthenics Logger".
As the name implies, with this app, users are able to log their calisthenics workouts.

Some basic exercise templates are prepared initially (pullups, pushups, dips, ...).
In order to allow greater flexibility, users can create their very own exercise templates whose instantiations are assigned various metadata (reps, weight, time, ...).

When starting a new workout, either a blank workout or a workout template can be used.
Workout templates are created by combining various exercise templates.
Logged workouts can be edited at any time.

Once there is a good amount of logged data, it makes sense to use the built in analytics tool to monitor progress in a less numerical and more visual way.
Detailed filters can be applied to create nice looking graphs.
